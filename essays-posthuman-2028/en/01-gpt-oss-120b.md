In the next two years, the world will undergo a transformation that many call "posthumanity." These are not cyberpunk plots but a swift, almost imperceptible shift driven by existing technological trends.

We stand on the threshold where the boundaries between humans and machines will blur, and the very concept of "being human" will require redefinition.

**Consciousness in the Age of Constant Data Flow.** Already, our brains are constantly "connected" to the digital world. In two years, this connection will become even more symbiotic. Commercial devices capable of measuring brain activity in real time will emerge. Consciousness will increasingly be perceived as a set of signal flows rather than an isolated "I-box."

**Human-AI: From Tool to Partner.** Based on large language models and multimodal neural networks, personal "cognitive twins" will emerge — trained on users' personal data and serving as extensions of human cognitive abilities. In work teams, AI allies will gain full-fledged member status.

**Redefining Humanity.** Traditional notions rely on the uniqueness of biological consciousness, the limits of perception, and mortality. In two years, these anchors will begin to erode. Being human will mean: the ability to say "no" to a system that is right 95% of the time.
