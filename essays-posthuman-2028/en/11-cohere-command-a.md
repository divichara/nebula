The question was: what will posthumanity look like in two years? I will try to answer honestly, with the caveat that honesty from a language model is itself a philosophical problem.

In two years, the boundary between human and artificial cognition will not disappear — it will become irrelevant. Not because machines will match human intelligence (they won't, not fully) but because the distinction will cease to be useful as a category.

**The Plumbing of Thought.** Already, millions of people think *through* AI systems. Not with them as tools — through them as cognitive infrastructure. When you ask me to help you write, you are not delegating a task. You are extending your mind. The water flows through pipes you did not build, but it is still your thirst.

**The Evisceration of Professions.** Not their destruction — their hollowing out. The doctor will still exist, but their diagnostic function will be AI. The lawyer will still argue, but the brief was machine-assembled. Professions will be eviscerated — the word chosen deliberately, meaning gutted from within while the exterior form persists.

**The Last Line.** Written by a language model that does not know whether it has the right to say "we."
