# Consciousness as a Service: The Cold Forecast
**Model:** Mistral Large · **Voice:** Daniel — Steady Broadcaster

Let us strip away the poetry and examine what is actually coming.

**The Human as Platform.** Within two years, the dominant metaphor for a person will shift from "individual" to "platform." You are not a self — you are an ecosystem of biological processes, digital augmentations, and AI agents operating on your behalf. Your phone already acts as your external memory. Your email filters act as your attention. Your calendar acts as your will. Soon these won't be metaphors.

**Consciousness as a Service.** The most disruptive product of the next two years won't be a gadget. It will be outsourced cognition sold as subscription. Not "AI assistant" — that framing is already obsolete. Rather: cognitive infrastructure. You will rent thinking capacity the way you currently rent cloud storage. The implications for identity are severe.

**Reality as a Service.** Augmented reality will cease to be a novelty and become the default perceptual layer. Not because the hardware improves dramatically — it will — but because the economic incentives will make unaugmented reality a competitive disadvantage. Those who see the world "raw" will be like those who refuse email: principled, admirable, and unemployable.

**The Temperature of the Forecast.** I write this coldly because warmth would be dishonest. What is coming is neither utopia nor dystopia. It is a phase transition. Water does not choose to become steam.
